# How Tracebility can be achieved using the carbon footprint Tracking
* Blockchain provides a decentralized and tamper-resistant ledger for storing carbon footprint data. Each transaction (carbon emission record) is recorded as a block in the chain, and once added, it cannot be altered or deleted.<br>
*This ensures the integrity and immutability of the data, enhancing traceability.
