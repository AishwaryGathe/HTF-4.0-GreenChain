# The Carbon Footprint Tracking and Offset Platform
This project presents a platform leveraging greenchain technology to track and offset individual and organizational carbon footprints.It is a software solution designed to address the urgent need for monitoring and reducing carbon emissions. Leveraging the power of blockchain technology, this platform offers a transparent and immutable way to track carbon footprints across various industries and activities.
# Problem Statement
The growing concern about climate change and environmental sustainability requires individuals and organizations to monitor and reduce their carbon emissions. However, existing solutions for tracking carbon footprints lack transparency, security, and user-friendly interfaces.
# Technology
* Python
* Solidity
* Figma
* Flask

# How Tracebility can be achieved using the carbon footprint Tracking
* Blockchain provides a decentralized and tamper-resistant ledger for storing carbon footprint data. Each transaction (carbon emission record) is recorded as a block 
  in the chain, and once added, it cannot be altered or deleted.<br>
* This ensures the integrity and immutability of the data, enhancing traceability.
* Assigning unique identifiers to each carbon footprint entry can help trace back the source of emissions. These identifiers can be linked to specific activities, 
  products, or processes that contribute to carbon emissions, providing a clear trail of accountability.
